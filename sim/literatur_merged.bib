	abstract = {We examine the implications of arbitrage in a market with many assets. The absence of arbitrage opportunities implies that the linear functionals that give the mean and cost of a portfolio are continuous; hence there exist unique portfolios that represent these functionals. These portfolios span the mean-variance efficient set. We resolve the question of when a market with many assets permits so much diversification that risk-free investment opportunities are available. Ross [12, 14] showed that if there is a factor structure, then the mean returns are approximately linear functions of factor loadings. We define an approximate factor structure and show that this weaker restriction is sufficient for Ross' result. If the covariance matrix of the asset returns has only K unbounded eigenvalues, then there is an approximate factor structure and it is unique. The corresponding K eigenvectors converge and play the role of factor loadings. Hence only a principal component analysis is needed in empirical work.},

	abstract = {A dynamic factor model is proposed in that factor dynamics are driven by stochastic time trends describing arbitrary persistence levels. The proposed model is essentially a long memory factor model, which nests standard I(0) and I(1) behavior smoothly in common factors. In the estimation, principal components analysis (PCA) and conditional sum of squares (CSS) estimations are employed. For the dynamic model parameters, centered normal asymptotics are established at the usual parametric rates, and their small-sample properties are explored via Monte-Carlo experiments. The method is then applied to a panel of U.S. industry realized volatilities.}

	journal = {Journal of Business \& Economic Statistics},
	year = {2000},
	volume = {18},
	pages = {254-262},
	number = {2},
	abstract = { Recent empirical studies show that the squares of high-frequency
	stock returns are long-range dependent and can be modeled as fractionally
	integrated processes, using, for example, long-memory stochastic
	volatility models. Are such long-range dependencies common among
	stocks? Are they caused by the same sources of variation? In this
	article, we classify daily stock returns of Standard and Poor 500
	companies on the basis of a company's size and its business or industrial
	sector and estimate the strength of long-range dependence in the
	stock volatilities using two different methods. Almost all of the
	companies analyzed exhibit strong persistence in volatility. We then
	use a canonical correlation method to identify common long-range
	dependent components in groups of companies, finding strong evidence
	in support of common persistence in volatility. Finally, we use a
	chi-squared test to study the effects of company size and sector
	on the number of common long-range dependent volatility components
	detected in groups of companies. Our results indicate the existence
	of some size effects, although they are not related to company size
	in a monotonic manner. On the other hand, the effects of company
	sector are pronounced. Randomly selected companies are found to be
	driven by a significantly larger number of persistent components
	than companies in certain business sectors, implying that persistence
	in stock volatility of companies in the same sector is more likely
	caused by the same source. These results suggest, among other interesting
	implications, that the volatilities of stocks for companies in the
	same business sector will be more often tied together in the longer
	run than will the volatilities of companies grouped only on the basis
	of size. },

We 1rst discuss the de1nition of fractional cointegration. The initial step of cointegration analysis entails partitioning the vector series into subsets with identical di0erencing parameters, by means of a sequence of hypothesis tests. We then estimate cointegrating rank by analysing each subset individually. Two approaches are considered here, both of which are based on the eigenvalues of an estimate of the normalized spectral density matrix at frequency zero.

First, we argue for the output-gap view that the business cycle corresponds to transitory deviations in economic activity away from a permanent, or trend, level. Then we investigate the extent to which a general model-based approach to estimating trend and cycle for the U.S. economy leads to measures of the business cycle that reflect models versus the data. We find empirical support for a nonlinear time series model that produces a business cycle measure with an asymmetric shape across NBER expansion and recession phases. Specifically, this business cycle measure suggests that recessions are periods of relatively large and negative transitory fluctuations in output. However, several close competitors to the nonlinear model produce business cycle measures of widely differing shapes and magnitudes. Given this model-based uncertainty, we construct a model-averaged measure of the business cycle. This measure also displays an asymmetric shape and is closely related to other measures of economic slack such as the unemployment rate and capacity utilization. © 2011 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.}

If nominal interest rates have a unit root but inflation and inflation forecast errors do not, then ex ante real interest rates have a unit root and are therefore nonstationary. This deduction does not depend on the properties of the unobservable ex post observed real return, which combines the ex ante real interest rate and inflation-forecasting errors. The unit-root characteristic of real interest rates is puzzling from at least two perspectives: many models imply that the growth rate of consumption and the real interest rate should have similar time-series characteristics; also, nominal returns for other assets (e.g., stocks and bonds) appear to have different times-series properties from those of treasury bills.},

This paper argues that these results can be attributed in part to the low power of univariate tests, and that the use of panel data can generate more powerful tests. For this purpose, we propose two new panel cointegration tests that can be applied under very general conditions, and that are shown by simulation to be more powerful than other existing tests. These tests are applied to a panel of quarterly data covering 20 OECD countries between 1980 and 2004. The evidence suggest that the Fisher effect cannot be rejected once the panel evidence on cointegration has been taken into account. Copyright Â© 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

For important predictor variables, like the dividend-price ratio and nominal and real interest rates, we estimate orders of integration around 0.8. This leads to substantial increases of the estimated long-term risk of stocks, bonds, 
	and cash compared to estimates obtained from a stationary VAR. Results are sensitive to the inclusion of the short-term nominal interest rate in the prediction equation of excess stock returns. Jointly with the dividend-price ratio it has significant predictive power, but contrary to the dividend-price ratio the nominal interest rate does not induce mitigating effects through mean reversion.}

Econometric tests indicate that this common-stochastic-trend/cointegration implication is consistent with postwar U.S. data.

	abstract = { Optimization of the part of consumers is shown to imply that the marginal utility of consumption evolves according to a random walk with trend. To a reasonable approximation, consumption itself should evolve in the same way. In particular, no variable apart from current consumption should be of any value in predicting future consumption. This implication is tested with time-series data for the postwar United States. It is confirmed for real disposable income, which has no predictive power for consumption, but rejected for an index of stock prices. The paper concludes that the evidence supports a modified version of the life cycle--permanent income hypothesis. }

	abstract = {Past empirical analysis of the relationship between wages and prices within the expectations-augmented Phillips curve model have raised doubts about the effects of labor costs on inflation. Analysis of the same data used previously reveals the existence of a deterministic linear time component in the wage and price series which past research failed to take into account. Using the Johansen (1988, 1992b, 1994b) multivariate cointegration technique, the paper provides robust evidence on the consistency of the markup view of the inflation process with the data and concludes that monetary policy should profit from labor costs data in predicting future rates of inflation.},

A Phillips curve-type regression is shown to deliver estimates that do not mimic low-frequency movements in unemployment rates, even when a drift is included in the specification of the NAIRU. Standard errors around the estimates are extremely large. Using information about the behavior of unemployment, in addition to inflation, alleviates both these shortcomings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Using a novel decomposition that allows for deviations of unemployment from its flow steady state, we find that fluctuations in both inflow and outflow rates contribute substantially to unemployment variation within countries. Anglo-Saxon economies exhibit approximately a 15:85 inflow-outflow split to unemployment variation, while continental European and Nordic countries display closer to a 45:55 split. In all economies, increases in inflows lead increases in unemployment, whereas outflows lag a ramp-up in unemployment. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

A new estimator of the long memory parameter in these models is proposed, based on the simple linear regression of the log periodogram on a deterministic regressor. The estimator is the ordinary least squares estimator of the slope parameter in this regression, formed using only the lowest frequency ordinates of the log periodogram. Its asymptotic distribution is derived, from which it is evident that the conventional interpretation of these least squares statistics is justified in large samples. Using synthetic data the asymptotic theory proves to be reliable in samples of 50 observations or more. For three postwar monthly economic time series, the estimated integrated series model provides more reliable out-of-sample forecasts than do more conventional procedures.},

Additional flexibility for the short memory properties of the model can be attained by using the fractional lag perator of Johansen (2008) in the vector autoregressive polynomial. However, it also makes maximum likelihood estimation more diffcult. In this paper we first identify parameter settings for univariate and bivariate models that suffer from poor identification in finite samples and may therefore lead to estimation problems. Second, we propose to investigate the extent of poor identification by using expected log-likelihoods and variations thereof which are faster to simulate than multivariate finite sample distributions of parameter estimates. Third, we provide a line of reasoning that explains the finding from several univariate and bivariate simulation examples that the two-step estimator suggested by Tschernig, Weber, and Weigand (2010) can be more robust with respect to estimating the deterministic components than the maximum likelihood estimator.},

Our model enables a tractable quantitative analysis of optimal policy. For baseline parameter values for the COVID-19 pandemic applied to the US, we find that optimal policies differentially targeting risk/age groups significantly outperform optimal uniform policies and most of the gains can be realized by having stricter lockdown policies on the oldest group. Intuitively, a strict and long lockdown for the most vulnerable group both reduces infections and enables less strict lockdowns for the lower-risk groups. We also study the impacts of group distancing, testing and contract tracing, the matching technology and the expected arrival time of a vaccine on optimal policies. Overall, targeted policies that are combined with measures that reduce interactions between groups and increase testing and isolation of the infected can minimize both economic losses and deaths in our model.},

For example, a 10 percentage point increase in the positive test rate is associated with a 2 percentage point increase in the death rate among reported cases.

Most climate change researchers would agree with this statement despite the absence of a study that formally analyzes the relationship between emissions and GDP at business cycle frequencies. The paper provides a rigorous empirical analysis of this relationship in a comprehensive cross-country panel by decomposing the emissions and GDP series into their growth and cyclical components using the HP filter. Focusing on the cyclical components, four robust facts emerge: (1) Emissions are procyclical. (2) Procyclicality of emissions is positively correlated with GDP per capita. (3) Emissions are cyclically more volatile than GDP. (4) Cyclical volatility of emissions is negatively correlated with GDP per capita. These facts are potentially important for the calibration of theoretical models used to evaluate climate change mitigation policies.}

(b) Filtered values at the end of the sample are very different from those in the middle and are also characterized by spurious dynamics. (c) A statistical formalization of the problem typically produces values for the smoothing parameter vastly at odds with common practice. (d) There is a better alternative. A regression of the variable at date t on the four most recent values as of date t - h achieves all the objectives sought by users of the HP filter with none of its drawbacks.}",

It complements the results of Baxter and King (1999) with an analytical analysis, demonstrating that the filter parameter should be adjusted by multiplying it with the fourth power of the observation frequency ratios. This yields an HP parameter value of 6.25 for annual data given a value of 1600 for quarterly data. The relevance of the suggestion is illustrated empirically.}",

	abstract = {We discuss several major econometric problems that have been ignored in the empirical environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) literature thus far. These are: First, the use of nonlinear transformations of integrated regressors and second, in a panel context, cross-sectional dependence in the data. Both problems fundamentally invalidate the use of widely applied time series and panel unit root and cointegration techniques. We use the important special case of the relationship between GDP and CO2 (and SO2) emissions to show and discuss in detail that the seemingly strong evidence for an inverted U-shaped relationship between these variables obtained with commonly used methods is entirely spurious and vanishes when resorting to estimation strategies that take the discussed problems into account.}
